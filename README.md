## Formatting Tiny-ImageNet for Pytorch

First, you need to unzip the .zip file. Then you can put this .py file under the folder of ./tiny-imagenet-200/val/, and run the command: 

`python3 formatting_TinyImageNet.py`

When you are done, your val folder will contain 200 folders with 50 images in each folder. I kindly suggest you to read [my blog](https://mathfirst.github.io/notes/2022/05/19/How-Can-We-Use-Tiny-Imagenet-Dataset-in-Pytorch) for more information about this topic.
